Utilizing three independent models (Item popularity, item similarity,
Rank factorization), we were able to recommend five different titles using
these methods. The item popularity method was discovered to have a lower RSME
than the other two models with a 1.0417 error margin. Rank factorization not
far behind with 1.4 RSME. Using the item popularity model, the top five recommendations
was easier to find due to similar genres with equivalent ratings.
